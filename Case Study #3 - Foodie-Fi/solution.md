### A. Customer Journey
Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.

````sql
select *, 
case when s.plan_id=0 then 1
else 0 end as trial,
case when s.plan_id=1 then 1
else 0 end as basic_monthly,
case when s.plan_id=2 then 1
else 0 end as pro_monthly,
case when s.plan_id=3 then 1
else 0 end as pro_annual,
case when s.plan_id=4 then 1
else 0 end as churn
from subscriptions as s
join plans as p on s.plan_id=p.plan_id;
````

Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also want to run some sort of join to make your explanations a bit easier!
````sql

SELECT 
    subquery.plan_name,
    subquery.price,
    COUNT(subquery.customer_id) as customers,
    SUM(subquery.trial) AS trials,
    SUM(subquery.basic_monthly) AS basics,
    SUM(subquery.pro_monthly) AS monthly,
    SUM(subquery.pro_annual) AS annual,
    SUM(subquery.churn) AS churn
FROM (
	select customer_id, s.plan_id, plan_name, price, 
	case when s.plan_id=0 then 1 else 0 end as trial,
	case when s.plan_id=1 then 1 else 0 end as basic_monthly,
	case when s.plan_id=2 then 1 else 0 end as pro_monthly,
	case when s.plan_id=3 then 1 else 0 end as pro_annual,
	case when s.plan_id=4 then 1 else 0 end as churn

## B. Data Analysis Questions
1. How many customers has Foodie-Fi ever had?
````sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS customers
FROM subscriptions;

2. What is the monthly distribution of trial plan start_date values for our dataset - use the start of the month as the group by value
````sql
SELECT DATE_FORMAT(start_date, '%Y-%m-01') AS month_start,
       COUNT(*) AS trial_count
FROM subscriptions
GROUP BY DATE_FORMAT(start_date, '%Y-%m-01')
ORDER BY trial_count desc;
````

3. What plan start_date values occur after the year 2020 for our dataset? Show the breakdown by count of events for each plan_name

6. What is the number and percentage of customer plans after their initial free trial?
````sql

	group by customer_id) as subquery2) as subquery3;
````

7. What is the customer count and percentage breakdown of all 5 plan_name values at 2020-12-31?
````sql
select plan_name, count(*) 
from(
	select start_date, plan_name, s.plan_id 
	fROM subscriptions AS s
	JOIN plans AS p ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
	where start_date <= '2020-12-31'
order by start_date desc) as subquery

8. How many customers have upgraded to an annual plan in 2020?
````sql
select count(*) as pro_annual_2020 from (select plan_name, start_date, customer_id
fROM subscriptions AS s
JOIN plans AS p ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
where start_date >= '2020-01-01' and start_date <'2021-01-01' and plan_name = 'pro annual') subquery;
````

9. How many days on average does it take for a customer to an annual plan from the day they join Foodie-Fi?
````sql
select round(avg(days_to_annual),2) as average_days_to_annual
from( 
	select customer_id, trial, annual, DATEDIFF(annual, trial) AS days_to_annual from
	(select customer_id, max(trial_date) as trial, max(basic_monthly_date) as monthly, max(pro_monthly_date) as monthly_pro, max(pro_annual_date) as annual, max(churn_date) as churn

		JOIN plans AS p ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id) as subquery 
	group by customer_id) subquery2
where annual <> 0) subquery3;
````

10. Can you further breakdown this average value into 30 day periods (i.e. 0-30 days, 31-60 days etc)
````sql
select days_to_annual, count(*) as customers from (SELECT customer_id,
CASE

	group by customer_id) as subquery2
    where annual <> 0) as subquery3) as subquery4
    group by days_to_annual;
````

11. How many customers downgraded from a pro monthly to a basic monthly plan in 2020?
````sql
select count(*) as downgrades
from (select customer_id, basic_monthly_date, pro_monthly_date, DATEDIFF(pro_monthly_date, basic_monthly_date) AS days_basic_pro  
from (select customer_id, max(basic_monthly_date) as basic_monthly_date, max(pro_monthly_date) as pro_monthly_date

    order by days_basic_pro) as subquery3
    where days_basic_pro <0;
````

## C. Challenge Payment Question
The Foodie-Fi team wants you to create a new payments table for the year 2020 that includes amounts paid by each customer in the subscriptions table with the following requirements:
* monthly payments always occur on the same day of month as the original start_date of any monthly paid plan
* upgrades from basic to monthly or pro plans are reduced by the current paid amount in that month and start immediately
* upgrades from pro monthly to pro annual are paid at the end of the current billing period and also starts at the end of the month period
* once a customer churns they will no longer make payments

````sql
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN grouping(subquery3.plan) = 1 THEN 'Total' 
        ELSE subquery3.plan 
    END AS plan_name,

## D. Outside The Box Questions
The following are open ended questions which might be asked during a technical interview for this case study - there are no right or wrong answers, but answers that make sense from both a technical and a business perspective make an amazing impression!

1. How would you calculate the rate of growth for Foodie-Fi?
````sql
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN grouping(subquery3.n_month) = 1 THEN 'Total' 
        ELSE subquery3.n_month

    COUNT(customer) AS customer,
    ROUND(AVG(price), 2) AS price,
    ROUND(SUM(periods), 2) AS periods,
    ROUND(SUM(payments), 2) AS paid
FROM (
    SELECT 
        subquery2.*,
        ROUND((price * periods), 2) AS payments
    FROM (
        SELECT 
            subquery.*,
            CASE 
                WHEN subquery.plan = 0 THEN 
                    (DATE_FORMAT(to_date, '%m') - DATE_FORMAT(since, '%m'))
                ELSE 
                    ((DATE_FORMAT(to_date, '%m') - DATE_FORMAT(since, '%m')) - 1) 
            END AS periods
        FROM (

3. What are some key customer journeys or experiences that you would analyse further to improve customer retention?
Answer: churn should be taken into consideration

4. If the Foodie-Fi team were to create an exit survey shown to customers who wish to cancel their subscription, what questions would you include in the survey?
Answer: the Foodie team should ask the customers if they are happy with the present subscrition

5.a What business levers could the Foodie-Fi team use to reduce the customer churn rate? 
* Enhance Customer Experience
* Offer Incentives and Discounts
* Improve Food Quality and Variety
* Streamline Order and Delivery Process
* Collect and Act on Customer Feedback

5.b How would you validate the effectiveness of your ideas?
A/B Testing: Implement changes or improvements to the platform in different user segments and compare the churn rates between the control group (no changes) and the test group (with changes).
