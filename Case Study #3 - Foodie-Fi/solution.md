-- C. Challenge Payment Question
-- The Foodie-Fi team wants you to create a new payments table for the year 2020 that includes amounts paid by each customer in the subscriptions table with the following requirements:
-- monthly payments always occur on the same day of month as the original start_date of any monthly paid plan
-- upgrades from basic to monthly or pro plans are reduced by the current paid amount in that month and start immediately
-- upgrades from pro monthly to pro annual are paid at the end of the current billing period and also starts at the end of the month period
-- once a customer churns they will no longer make payments

-- What are some key customer journeys or experiences that you would analyse further to improve customer retention?
-- Answer: churn should be taken into consideration

-- If the Foodie-Fi team were to create an exit survey shown to customers who wish to cancel their subscription, what questions would you include in the survey?
-- Answer: the Foodie team should ask the customers if they are happy with the present subscrition

-- What business levers could the Foodie-Fi team use to reduce the customer churn rate? 
-- Enhance Customer Experience
-- Offer Incentives and Discounts
-- Improve Food Quality and Variety
-- Streamline Order and Delivery Process
-- Collect and Act on Customer Feedback

-- How would you validate the effectiveness of your ideas?
-- A/B Testing: Implement changes or improvements to the platform in different user segments and compare the churn rates between the control group (no changes) and the test group (with changes).

-- Conclusion
-- This case study should reflect realistic questions we usually focus on for all product related analytics requests in a wide variety of industries, especially in the digital space!
