-- Introduction
-- Clique Bait is not like your regular online seafood store - the founder and CEO Danny, was also a part of a digital data analytics team and wanted to expand his knowledge into the seafood industry!
-- In this case study - you are required to support Dannyâ€™s vision and analyse his dataset and come up with creative solutions to calculate funnel fallout rates for the Clique Bait online store.

-- Available Data
-- For this case study there is a total of 5 datasets which you will need to combine to solve all of the questions.

-- 2. Digital Analysis
-- Using the available datasets - answer the following questions using a single query for each one:
-- How many users are there?
		SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS users
		FROM users;
        -- 500

-- How many cookies does each user have on average?
		SELECT ROUND(AVG(cookies), 2) AS avg_cookies
		FROM (
			SELECT user_id, COUNT(cookie_id) AS cookies
			FROM users
			GROUP BY user_id
			) AS subquery;
			-- 3.56

-- What is the unique number of visits by all users per month?

-- 3. Campaigns Analysis
-- Generate a table that has 1 single row for every unique visit_id record and has the following columns:
	-- user_id
	-- visit_id
	-- visit_start_time: the earliest event_time for each visit
	-- page_views: count of page views for each visit
	-- cart_adds: count of product cart add events for each visit
	-- purchase: 1/0 flag if a purchase event exists for each visit
	-- campaign_name: map the visit to a campaign if the visit_start_time falls between the start_date and end_date
	-- impression: count of ad impressions for each visit
	-- click: count of ad clicks for each visit
-- (Optional column) cart_products: a comma separated text value with products added to the cart sorted by the order they were added to the cart (hint: use the sequence_number)
-- Use the subsequent dataset to generate at least 5 insights for the Clique Bait team - bonus: prepare a single A4 infographic that the team can use for their management reporting sessions, be sure to emphasise the most important points from your findings.
-- Some ideas you might want to investigate further include:
	-- Identifying users who have received impressions during each campaign period and comparing each metric with other users who did not have an impression event
	-- Does clicking on an impression lead to higher purchase rates?
	-- What is the uplift in purchase rate when comparing users who click on a campaign impression versus users who do not receive an impression? What if we compare them with users who just an impression but do not click?
	-- What metrics can you use to quantify the success or failure of each campaign compared to eachother?
    
    
-- Conclusion
-- This case study is based off my many years working with Digital datasets in consumer banking and retail supermarkets - all of the datasets are designed based off real datasets Iâ€™ve come across in challenging problem solving scenarios and the questions reflect similar problems which I worked on.
-- Campaign analysis is almost everywhere in the data world, especially in marketing, digital, UX and retail industries - and being able to analyse views, clicks and other digital behaviour is a critical skill to have in your toolbelt as a data professional!
